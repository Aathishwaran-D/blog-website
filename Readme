Here's a **mini documentation** for your React component-based CRUD blog app, specifically focusing on the `DeletePost` component and how it integrates with the rest of the application.

## 📝 Mini Documentation: DeletePost Component for Blog App

### 📁 File: `DeletePost.jsx`

### 📌 Purpose:
The `DeletePost` component is used to display all blog posts from the database and allow users to delete any post. It performs a `GET` request to fetch all posts and a `DELETE` request to remove a selected post by its ID.

---

### ✅ Features:
- Fetches all blog posts on component mount using `axios`.
- Displays posts in a styled HTML table.
- Provides a delete button for each post.
- Confirms deletion via `window.confirm`.
- Refreshes the list after deletion.

---

### 📦 Dependencies:
- React
- Axios (`npm install axios`)
- Backend API (assumed to be running on `http://localhost:8001/posts`)

---

### 🧩 Component Breakdown:

#### **State Variables:**
```js
const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
```
- Stores the list of posts fetched from the backend.

#### **useEffect Hook:**
```js
useEffect(() => {
    fetchPosts();
}, []);
```
- Runs once after the component mounts to load initial data.

#### **fetchPosts Function:**
```js
const fetchPosts = async () => {
    const res = await axios.get('http://localhost:8001/posts');
    setPosts(res.data);
};
```
- Calls backend API to retrieve all posts.

#### **handleDelete Function:**
```js
const handleDelete = async (postId) => {
    await axios.delete(`http://localhost:8001/posts/${postId}`);
    fetchPosts(); // Refresh list
};
```
- Sends DELETE request to backend to remove a post by ID.

---

### 📃 UI Output:
- A centered `h2` title.
- A table with columns: Title, Content, Author, Created At, and Action.
- Each row includes a "Delete" button that triggers `handleDelete`.

---

### 🔗 Route Setup (React Router):
Add this to `App.jsx` or your routing file:

```jsx
import DeletePost from './components/DeletePost';

<Routes>
  <Route path="/delete" element={<DeletePost />} />
</Routes>
```

---

### 📌 API Contract:

#### `GET /posts`
- Returns all blog posts.

#### `DELETE /posts/{id}`
- Deletes the post with the specified ID.

---

### 🧪 Optional Enhancements:
- Use toast notifications instead of `alert()`.
- Add a loading spinner during fetch/delete.
- Implement pagination if posts grow large.
